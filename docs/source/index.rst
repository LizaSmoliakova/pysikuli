Welcome to Pysikuli's documentation!
============================================

**Pysikuli** initially inspired by `Sikuli Project <http://sikulix.com/>`_ and
secondly by python automation tool `pyautogui <https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui>`_ and the quick image search in
`python-imagesearch <https://github.com/drov0/python-imagesearch>`_ library. 
So if you already know about **SikuliX** or **pyautogui**, but want to speed up your scripts to the max, you're in the right place.
